== Basic Usage

=== CSV Format

.Your data must be formated as follows:
- First row (`Header`) contains all groups for each `Dataset`. Keep in mind, that the first entry will be omitted.
- The `Header` must be separated from the following `Dataset` by at least one empty row.
- Each `Dataset` starts with the corresponding `Title` followed by a row of the labels.
- Two `Datasets` must be separated by at least one empty row.
- The default delimiter is ','. If you wan't to use another format, please refere to the `Advanced` section.

The following table depicts an example format. You can create a file from scratch or use the provided `example.csv` for guidance.
